Hi, I’m Aryan. I write code, chase ideas at odd hours, and frequently wonder if I’m doing any of it right.

I’m an undergrad at NSUT (Batch of 2027), currently on a mission to blend full-stack development with Generative AI.  
Still learning, still doubting, still building.

Some days I ship. Some days I scrap everything and start over.  
Most days, I’m just trying to get 1% better without burning out.

### 👽 A Bit About Me
- Trying to keep up with a world that updates faster than my GPT Chat History.
- Quietly shipping weird projects and calling it “learning”.
- I’m a pretty private person — so my best stuff is either private or not perfect enough to show (classic overthinker things). But feel free to **reach out**, I’ll send you what I’ve built or walk you through it.
