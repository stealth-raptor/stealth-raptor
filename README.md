> “The Force will be with you… eventually.” – Me, to myself, daily.

Hi, I’m Aryan. I write code, build with AI and frequently wonder if I’m doing any of it right.

I’m an Electrical Engineering undergrad at NSUT (Batch of 2027), currently on a mission to blend full-stack development with Generative AI.  
Still learning, still doubting, still building.

### 👽 A Bit About Me
- Trying to keep up with a world that updates faster than my Git pull.
- Quietly shipping weird projects and calling it “learning”.
- I’m a pretty private person — so my best stuff is either private or not perfect enough to show (classic overthinker things). But feel free to **reach out**, I’ll send you what I’ve built or walk you through it.
